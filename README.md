Title: Impact of Type 2 Diabetes on Dementia in older people
Study Background and objectives:
There has been studies conducted on finding the association between diabetes and dementia. But not particularly for finding the association between type 2 diabetes (t2d) and dementia. In this study the association between t2d and dementia are analyzed as the primary objective. The secondary objective of the study is to find the impact of other life factors on Dementia.
Dataset Description: I have used two datasets of which the Dementia cohort (dem_coh) was obtained from SAIL DEMENTIA E COHORT and the Diabetes cohort (diab_coh) was provided by James Rafferty (based on paper: A Retrospective Epidemiological Study of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Wales, UK between 2008-2018, James Rafferty, Apr 20, 2021.). The filtering and data set merging used are depicted in the following flowchart.
Analysis: Proportion of Type 2 Diabetic Patients in the Dementia Cohort has been found and depicted in the Table 1 (primary end Analysis). For the secondary end point analysis, the summary statistics of risk factors are analyzed on the table 2(overall summary) and 3 (between type 2 and non-type 2 diabetics). In Table 4, regression analysis(logistic) has been depicted.
